# Product Requirements Document: Supabase Integration for AI Cooking & Fitness Assistant

## 1. Overview

### Purpose
Add persistent data storage to the AI Cooking & Fitness Assistant to enable users to save their chat conversations, build a personal recipe collection, track workouts, monitor calorie intake, and access their health/nutrition data across sessions and devices.

### Problem Statement
Currently, all chat conversations are ephemeral (lost on page refresh). Users cannot:
- Access previous cooking and fitness conversations
- Save recipes and workout plans they discover through AI interactions
- Build a personal cookbook and workout library over time
- Track their calorie consumption and fitness progress
- Resume conversations where they left off
- Access their data from different devices
- Monitor their health and fitness goals over time

### Success Metrics
- Users can save and retrieve chat history (cooking and fitness)
- Users can bookmark and organize recipes and workouts
- Users can track daily calorie intake and expenditure
- Users can monitor fitness progress over time
- 100% data persistence across browser sessions
- Zero performance degradation in chat streaming
- Secure user authentication and data isolation
