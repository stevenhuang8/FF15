# Supabase Feedback System Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up the database and storage for the feedback system.

## Prerequisites

- Access to your Supabase project dashboard
- Project URL and keys already configured in `.env.local`

---

## Part 1: Database Setup

### Step 1: Run the SQL Script

1. **Open Supabase Dashboard**
   - Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
   - Select your project

2. **Navigate to SQL Editor**
   - Click "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar
   - Click "New query"

3. **Copy and Run the SQL Script**
   - Open the file `supabase-feedback-setup.sql` in this project
   - Copy the entire contents
   - Paste into the SQL Editor
   - Click "Run" or press `Cmd/Ctrl + Enter`

4. **Verify Success**
   - You should see results from the verification queries at the bottom
   - Check that the table, indexes, and policies were created

### What This Creates

- âœ… `feedback` table with proper schema
- âœ… Indexes for performance (user_id, status, created_at, type)
- âœ… Row Level Security (RLS) enabled
- âœ… RLS policies for:
  - Authenticated users can submit feedback
  - Users can view their own feedback
  - Users can update their own feedback
  - Users can delete their own feedback
- âœ… Automatic `updated_at` timestamp trigger

---

## Part 2: Storage Bucket Setup

### Step 2: Create Storage Bucket

1. **Navigate to Storage**
   - In Supabase Dashboard, click "Storage" in the left sidebar
   - Click "New bucket"

2. **Configure Bucket**
   - **Name**: `feedback-attachments`
   - **Public bucket**: âœ… **YES** (Enable this)
   - **File size limit**: 5 MB
   - **Allowed MIME types**: Leave blank (we validate on client/server)
   - Click "Create bucket"

### Step 3: Set Up Storage Policies

1. **Click on the `feedback-attachments` bucket**
2. **Click "Policies" tab**
3. **Add the following policies:**

#### Policy 1: Allow Public Read Access

```sql
-- Name: Allow public to read attachments
-- Operation: SELECT
-- Target roles: public

CREATE POLICY "Allow public to read attachments"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
TO public
USING (bucket_id = 'feedback-attachments');
```

#### Policy 2: Allow Authenticated Users to Upload

```sql
-- Name: Allow authenticated users to upload
-- Operation: INSERT
-- Target roles: authenticated

CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to upload"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'feedback-attachments');
```

#### Policy 3: Allow Users to Delete Their Own Files

```sql
-- Name: Allow users to delete their own attachments
-- Operation: DELETE
-- Target roles: authenticated

CREATE POLICY "Allow users to delete their own attachments"
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
TO authenticated
USING (
  bucket_id = 'feedback-attachments'
  AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
);
```

### Alternative: Quick Setup via SQL

You can also run these policies in the SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Storage Policies for feedback-attachments bucket

-- Allow public read access
CREATE POLICY "Allow public to read attachments"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
TO public
USING (bucket_id = 'feedback-attachments');

-- Allow authenticated users to upload
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to upload"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'feedback-attachments');

-- Allow users to delete their own attachments
CREATE POLICY "Allow users to delete their own attachments"
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
TO authenticated
USING (
  bucket_id = 'feedback-attachments'
  AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
);
```

## Part 3: Verify Setup

### Test Database

1. **Check Table Exists**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM public.feedback LIMIT 1;
   ```
   - Should return empty result (no error)

2. **Test Insert (Optional)**
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO public.feedback (feedback_type, description, email)
   VALUES ('general', 'Test feedback from SQL', 'test@example.com')
   RETURNING *;
   ```
   - Should return the inserted row

3. **Clean Up Test Data (Optional)**
   ```sql
   DELETE FROM public.feedback WHERE description = 'Test feedback from SQL';
   ```

### Test Storage

1. **Navigate to Storage > feedback-attachments**
2. **Click "Upload file"**
3. **Try uploading a small image**
4. **Verify you can see the uploaded file**
5. **Delete the test file**

---

## Part 4: Test the App

### 1. Start Development Server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

### 2. Test Feedback Submission (Authenticated)

1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000
2. **Log in to your app**
3. Click the Help button (? icon) in the navbar
4. Fill out the form:
   - Type: Bug Report
   - Description: "Test feedback submission"
   - Email: your-email@example.com (optional)
   - Upload a screenshot (optional)
5. Click "Submit Feedback"
6. Should see success message

### 3. Verify in Supabase

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard > Table Editor > feedback
2. You should see your test submission with `user_id` populated

### 4. Test Feedback History Page

1. While logged in, navigate to http://localhost:3000/feedback
2. You should see your submitted feedback
3. Verify status badges, dates, and descriptions display correctly

### 5. Test HEIC Upload (iPhone/Mac Only)

1. Try uploading a .heic photo from your iPhone/Mac
2. Should automatically convert to JPEG and upload successfully

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Failed to fetch feedback history"

**Cause**: User not authenticated or RLS policies not set up correctly

**Solution**:
1. Make sure you're logged in
2. Verify RLS policies were created (check Part 1, Step 1)
3. Run this to check policies:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'feedback';
   ```

### Issue: "Upload failed: 403 Forbidden"

**Cause**: Storage bucket policies not set up correctly

**Solution**:
1. Verify bucket is public (Part 2, Step 2)
2. Verify storage policies were created (Part 2, Step 3)
3. Run this to check storage policies:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'objects' AND schemaname = 'storage';
   ```

### Issue: "Feedback table does not exist"

**Cause**: SQL script didn't run successfully

**Solution**:
1. Re-run the SQL script from `supabase-feedback-setup.sql`
2. Check for any error messages in the SQL Editor
3. Make sure you're running it on the correct project

### Issue: Users can't submit feedback while logged in

**Cause**: RLS policy for authenticated users not created properly

**Solution**:
```sql
-- Re-run the authenticated insert policy
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can submit feedback"
ON public.feedback
FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

---

## Next Steps

After successful setup:

1. âœ… Test feedback submission while authenticated
2. âœ… Test feedback history page for authenticated users
3. âœ… Test file uploads with various image formats (including HEIC)
4. âœ… Verify data appears correctly in Supabase dashboard
5. ðŸš€ Continue with Task 11.5: Admin Dashboard and Email Notifications

---

## Security Notes

- **Authentication required**: Only logged-in users can submit feedback
- **RLS is enabled**: Users can only see their own feedback
- **File uploads are validated**: Max 5MB, images only (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP, HEIC)
- **Storage is public**: Anyone with the URL can view attachments (acceptable for feedback screenshots)
- **User accountability**: All feedback is tied to a user account for better follow-up and spam prevention
- **Future enhancement**: Consider making storage private and using signed URLs for sensitive attachments
