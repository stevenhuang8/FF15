## Remaining Considerations

### Mobile Responsiveness
All new pages use responsive design:

- Navbar items stack appropriately

### Authentication
All new pages redirect to `/login` if user not authenticated:
- `/workouts` - Protected
- `/nutrition` - Protected

### User Experience Improvements
- Dialogs close after successful operations
- Tab switching on successful workout log (switches to history)
- Refresh key pattern for CalorieTracker updates
- Loading states for all data fetching
- Empty states with helpful messaging
